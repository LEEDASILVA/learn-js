// the arrayBuffer object is used to represent a generic, fixed-length raw binary data buffer
//We cannot directly manipulate the contents of an ArrayBuffe
//instead, you create one of the typed array objects or a DataView object which represents
// the buffer in a specific format,
// and use that to read and write the contents of the buffer.
